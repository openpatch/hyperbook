# Bitflow

[Bitflow](https://bitflow.openpatch.org/) is a great way for conducting dynamic flow-based
assessments. It can, for example, be used at the end of a chapter as a check-up.

## Flow

```md
::flow{src="/flow.json"}
```

::flow{src="/flow.json"}

The height of a flow defaults to 400px, but you can set a custom one like so:

```md
::flow{src="/flow.json" height="800px"}
```

::flow{src="/flow.json" height="800px"}

## Task

```md
::flow{src="/task.json"}
```

::flow{src="/task.json"}

The height of a task defaults to 400px, but you can set a custom one like so:

```md
::flow{src="/task.json" height="800px"}
```

::flow{src="/task.json" height="800px"}
