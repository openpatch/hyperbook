# Glossary

You can keep a glossary of important terms. Just fill the folder
`glossary` with markdown files. The name of the file will be the key of
the term. You can then reference the terms like so:

```md
:t[Object-oriented Programming]{#oop}
```

:t[Object-oriented Programming]{#oop}

You can also link directly to a header.

```md
:t[Object-oriented Programming]{#oop.bluej-by-example}
```

:t[Object-oriented Programming]{#oop.bluej-by-example}
