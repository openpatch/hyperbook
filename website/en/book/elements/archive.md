# Archive

All folders in the folder `archives` will be zipped when you build your
hyperbook. You can use the `archive` directive to add a download button for
these zipped folders. You only have to pass the folder name, everything else is
handled for you.

```md
:archive[Project Template]{name="project-1"}
```

:archive[Project Template]{name="project-1"}

This is useful for providing project templates, solutions for a coding problem etc.
