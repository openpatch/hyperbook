# Sub- and Superscript

With subscript and superscript, you can raise or lower text. This is especially useful for mathematical formulas or chemical compounds.

```md
H_{2}0

f^{2}(x)
```

H_{2}0

f^{2}(x)

Subscript and superscript can also be disabled by placing a backslashe before the subscript or superscript:

```md
H\_{2}0

f\^{2}(x)
```

H\_{2}0

f\^{2}(x)
