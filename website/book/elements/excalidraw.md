# Excalidraw

Excalidraw is an excellent tool that offers a whiteboard on which you can easily
sketch diagrams with a hand-drawn feel. You can use
[https://excalidraw.com/](https://excalidraw.com/), download your drawing as a
JSON-file, put it in the public directory and create an Excalidraw element (see
below).

You could also use the integrated editor in hyperbook. When running your
hyperbook in development mode, you see two buttons below an Excalidraw
whiteboard and all editor options. You can edit your whiteboard here and just
hit save. The Excalidraw will be saved at the place which you have defined.
