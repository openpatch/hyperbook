All you need for writing Hyperbooks (auto preview, snippets, auto-completion and more).

## Features

### Preview

You can preview your Hyperbook pages by clicking the preview icon in the top right-hand corner or by running the command `Show side preview`.

### Hyperbook Config

The `hyperbook.json` is validated against a schema, which presents you
from making mistakes. It also enables a color picker for your brand
color.

### Syntax Highlighting

Each element has its own syntax highlighting. So you know when you typed it right.

### Snippets

Each element can be inserted by using a snippet. Type `:` and hit your auto-completion key combo (default Ctrl+Space).
