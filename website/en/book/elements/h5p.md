# H5P

H5P is a free and open-source content collaboration framework based on JavaScript. H5P is short for HTML5 Package, and aims to make it easy for everyone to create, share and reuse interactive HTML5 content. H5P is a popular tool for creating interactive content, such as quizzes, presentations, and games.

You can embed H5P content in your book using the `h5p` element. You can load an H5P content from a file.

The src attribute is used to specify the path to the H5P file.

```md
::h5p{src="/test.h5p"}
```

::h5p{src="/test.h5p"}

The best way to create H5P content is to use the [ZUM Apps](https://apps.zum.de) website. You can create and edit H5P content on the website, and then download the content as an H5P file. For this you can use the Reuse button. You can then put the h5p file into your public folder and use it in a h5p-element.
