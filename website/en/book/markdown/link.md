# Link

There are two ways to create links.

```md
[Link in text](https://www.openpatch.org)

[Link in text with a title](https://www.openpatch.org "Webseite of OpenPatch")

[Reference link][case-insensitive reference text]

[Reference link with a number][1]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com>.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[case-insensitive reference text]: https://edugit.org
[1]: http://codeberg.org
```
