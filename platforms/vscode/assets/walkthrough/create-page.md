# Create a New Page

Add more pages to your book to organize your content into chapters or sections.

## How to create a new page:
1. Click "Create new page" above
2. Enter a name for your page (e.g., "getting-started")
3. The file will be created in the `book/` folder
4. Start writing your content!

## Tips:
- Use folders to organize related pages
- Create an `index.md` in each folder as the main page
- Link between pages using relative paths like `/getting-started`

Pages are automatically added to your book's navigation based on the folder structure.
