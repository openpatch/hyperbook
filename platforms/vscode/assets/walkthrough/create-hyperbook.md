# Create Your First Hyperbook

A Hyperbook is an interactive documentation and workbook platform. To get started:

1. Click the "Create Hyperbook" button above
2. Choose a name for your book
3. Fill in the details (description, author, license)
4. Wait for the project to be created

The extension will create a new Hyperbook project with:
- **hyperbook.json** - Configuration file
- **book/** - Folder containing your content pages
- **public/** - Static assets (images, files)
- **glossary/** - Term definitions (optional)

Once created, you'll have a fully functional Hyperbook ready to edit!
