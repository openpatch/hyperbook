# Edit Your Main Page

The `book/index.md` file is the main entry point of your Hyperbook. It's the first page users will see.

## What to include:
- A welcoming introduction
- Overview of what readers will learn
- Navigation to other sections

## Try it:
1. Click "Open index.md" above to open the file
2. Edit the content using Markdown
3. Use the preview button (top-right) to see your changes live

The preview will show your page rendered with Hyperbook's styling and interactive elements.
